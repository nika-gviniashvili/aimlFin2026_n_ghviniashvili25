In this task, I have analyzed a web server log file to detect possible DDoS attack intervals.
A DDoS attack usually causes a sudden increase in the number of requests sent to a server within a short period of time. My goal was to identify such abnormal spikes using regression analysis.

To achieve my goal,  instead of manually reviewing thousands of log entries, I used Python. I have developed the python code to process the data and detect unusual traffic behavior automatically.
The log file was given from: http://max.ge/aiml_final/n_ghviniashvili25_15289_server.log, which is currently also uploaded to my repository as well.
This log file seems to be a standard data format used to store captured network traffic, often generated by tools like Wireshark or tcpdump. These files contain raw data packets, including header information and timestamps.

About Methodology: 

First, I opened the log file and read it line by line. From each line, I extracted the timestamp using a regular expression. The timestamp is important because DDoS attacks are related to abnormal activity within specific time periods.

After extracting all timestamps, I created a pandas DataFrame and converted the timestamps into one-minute intervals using the floor("min") function. I grouped the data by minute and counted how many requests occurred in each minute. This allowed me to transform the raw log file into structured traffic data over time.

df = pd.DataFrame(times, columns=["time"])
df["time"] = df["time"].dt.floor("min")
traffic = df.groupby("time").size().reset_index(name="count")

Next, I applied Linear Regression using the LinearRegression() model from sklearn. I created a simple numeric time index and used it as the independent variable, while the number of requests per minute was used as the dependent variable. The regression model allowed me to estimate the general traffic trend over time.

traffic["x"] = range(len(traffic))
model = LinearRegression().fit(traffic[["x"]], traffic["count"])
pred = model.predict(traffic[["x"]])

The model calculated a best-fit line that represents the expected number of requests under normal conditions. After obtaining the predicted values, I compared them with the actual traffic values. The difference between the actual traffic and the predicted traffic is called the residual. This value shows how much the real traffic deviates from the normal trend.
To detect abnormal spikes, I calculated the residual values and defined a statistical threshold:

limit = res.mean() + 3 * res.std()

If the residual exceeded this limit, it indicated that the real traffic was much higher than what the regression model considered normal. In that case, I marked the corresponding time interval as a potential DDoS attack.

Finally, I generated a graph to visually compare actual traffic and predicted traffic, and after that i have printed the results. 
The graph shows clearly where the spike has occurred and confirms the detected attack interval.

About Results:
After running the script, the program identified time intervals where the number of requests was significantly higher than the predicted traffic from the regression model.

The output displayed:
Attention DDos was Detected
Start: 2024-03-22 18:09:00+04:00
End: 2024-03-22 18:13:00+04:00

These timestamps represent the period where traffic exceeded the calculated threshold and was flagged as abnormal.
In addition to the printed results, I also generated a graph that displays both the actual traffic and the predicted traffic from the regression model. In the visualization, the spike is clearly visible as a sharp increase above the regression line. This confirms that the detected interval corresponds to a sudden surge in requests, which is consistent with the behavior of a DDoS attack.

The visualization further confirmed the detected spike, making the DDoS interval clearly visible.

Overall, this method provided a simple and effective way to detect abnormal traffic patterns using regression analysis.
